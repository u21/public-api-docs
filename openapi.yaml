  - name: Entities
    description: >
      _Entities_ are typically businesses or users that have transactions on
      your platform.  The `/entities` endpoint can create, list, and update
      entities.
  - name: Events
    description: >
      Events have two types, _transaction events_  and _action events_:

      * Transaction events are any monetary flow that is sent or received by an
      entity on your system.

      * Action events are non-monetary changes of state that occur on your
      system, e.g. user logins. The `/events` endpoint sends and receives data
      about significant actions that occur with an entity or instrument on your
      system.  
  - name: Instruments
    description: >
      _Instruments_ represent any physical, digital, or logical intermediary
      between an entity and a transaction event. The `/instruments` endpoint can
      create, list, and update instruments. 
  - name: Devices
    description: >
      Devices representing any computer or physical device used to execute an
      event. Devices are most suitable when events can be traced back to a
      specific device fingerprint. The `/devices` endpoint can create, list, and
      update instruments. 
  - name: Agents
    description: >
      Agents are your organization's members who use the Unit21 system to
      investigate suspicious objects and events. The `/agents` endpoint can list
      your agents. 
  - name: Rules
    description: >
      Rules are the model logic that will find fraudulent and suspicious
      transactions and actions. Rules create alerts that can turn into cases
      with flagged entities, transactions and instruments. The `/rules` endpoint
      can get and list rules. 
  - name: Alerts
    description: >
      Alerts have two origins. Typically, alerts are generated whenever a Unit21
      detection tool (like a rule) flags an object, like an entity. However,
      your organization can also send alerts generated from your in-house
      detection systems. The `/alerts` endpoint can create, list, and update
      alerts. 
  - name: Cases
    description: >
      Cases are usually active investigations, which may span multiple events,
      entities and documents. They can be directly escalated into a suspicious
      activity report. The `/cases` endpoint can create, list, and update
      cases. 
  - name: Sars
    description: >
      Sars are cases that have been investigated and turned into a Suspicious
      Activity report with the intent to file it to FinCen. The `/sars` endpoint
      can get and list sars. 
  - name: Entity verification
    description: >
      Unit21 can execute entity verifications according to steps defined in
      system workflows. They can run when a new entity is added to the system,
      an update is made to an existing entity, or by directly triggering an API
      endpoint.
  - name: Verification forms
    description: >
      With verification forms, you can automate ID verification and user
      collection. To gather user input, the `verification forms` endpoint
      creates a URL. This URL is only valid for a specified period of time.
  - name: Tag associations
    description: >
      _Tags_ provide a flexible means of linking objects together in the Unit21
      system. You can use the `/tag-associations` endpoint to explore these
      associations.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: >
      Whenever an event happens on the Unit21 platform, Unit21 can send a
      webhook about the event to whatever URL you configure. Such events include
      entity verification results, generated alerts, case re-openings and
      closings, etcetera.
  - name: Blacklists
    description: >
      _Blacklists_ comprise one of the following categories: * of entities
      (users or business) * IPs (single or ranges) * strings
  - name: Datafiles
    description: >
      If you want to bulk upload multiple objects, you can send them via a POST
      to the `/datafiles` endpoint. For the fastest processing, the datafile
      SHOULD be a JSON file in the format of a typical POST request to this API.

        Creates a new event, sending event data in the request body. Two objects
        are required: `general_data` and either `transaction_data` or

        `event_type`, and `event_time`. `transaction_data` requires only the
        field `amount`.

              Though you can provide any string, Unit21 processes and display
              recognized `media_type` values with custom formatting. Unit21 can
              also use recognized media object types for dedicated requests,
              like document verification.

            This request has three possible components:

            * A media key name, any alphanumeric string (e.g. `profile_picture`

            * Optional media metadata. Stringified JSON data, sent as a value
            for the media key name.

             Here's an example request. In the path, replace `<OBJECT>` with whatever endpoint you want to reach, e.g. `entities`, `alerts`, etc.
